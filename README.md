### Project Collaboration

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/270e26877fdd815a9017da739a7c8dd7?v=270e26877fdd81c7a17a000c18496f82&source=copy_link) served as our central hub for organizing tasks and resources. We used it to:  
      - Share notes and useful links in one accessible space.  
      - Document meeting notes and decisions for easy reference. 
      - Track deadlines and assigned responsibilities through task boards.  
      - Enable real-time collaboration, reducing miscommunication and delays.

## Business Understanding
*At what price should one sell a product to remain competitive while still making a profit?*

### Problem Statement:
- Pricing is one of the most critical decisions for any seller. While costs, margins, and supplier agreements guide internal pricing, whatâ€™s often missing is visibility into how competitors price similar products. Without this context, sellers face two key risks:
    - Overpricing â†’ losing customers to cheaper alternatives.
    - Underpricing â†’ cutting into profits unnecessarily.

- New sellers entering marketplaces often struggle with:
    - Price variability â€“ Similar products can vary widely in price (e.g., KSh 499 vs KSh 8,900).
    - Discount strategy â€“ Discounts strongly influence buyers, but the "sweet spot" is unclear.

### Objectives: 
- This project aims to bridge that gap by providing data-driven insights from marketplace listings (e.g., product categories, ratings, reviews, discounts). By benchmarking against competitors, sellers gain real-time market information that complements their cost-based pricing strategies, enabling them to set prices that are both competitive and profitable.    

### Stakeholders
- New Sellers : Data-backed guidance on product selection & pricing.
- Marketplace (Jumia): Gains from onboarding more sellers and improving customer experience.
- Business Development Teams: Use insights to attract and support vendors.

### Potential Impact: 
- This tool can 
    - Help sellers price new products competitively from day one
    - Reduce the time sellers spend on manual competitor research
    - Increase sales conversions by ensuring listings are within market-accepted ranges

## Data Understanding

### Data Source
- The dataset we worked with was scraped from [Jumia](https://www.jumia.co.ke/). 
- It consist of 1,999 product listings with 13 features (columns) including: 
     - current_price â†’ Current product price.
     - original_price â†’ Price before discount
     - discount â†’ Discount percentage
     - main_category â†’ Product category (electronics, fashion, etc.)
     - rating_number & verified_ratings â†’ Customer satisfaction.
     - seller â†’ Who is selling the item.
     - title â†’ Product description.


### Data Preparation
- To prepare the dataset for analysis, we applied the following steps:  
   - Removed duplicates: Many sellers list the same product multiple times.
   - Handled missing values: Some products lacked ratings or discounts. Strategies included:
       - Filling missing numeric values with averages.
       - Dropping irrelevant text-only columns when not useful for modeling.
   - Converted datatypes: Prices were stored as strings (KSh 499 â†’ 499). Converted to integers.
   - Created new features:
       - discount_amount = original_price - current_price
       - discount_ratio = % discount offered

## Analysis Overview
- We explored the data to understand patterns and relationships in the data:
    - Price distribution:
         - Plotted Product prices across categories - Found that electronics (Phones, Tablets, Home & Office) have the widest price range.



    - Impact of discounts on product visibility.
         - Observed discounts up to 60%+.
         - Products with moderate discounts (10â€“30%) performed better than those with extreme discounts.



    - Category Analysis.
         - Phone  & Tablets and Home Electronics dominate listings.
         - Some categories are oversaturated, suggesting sellers should focus on niches within electronics.



    - Customer ratings as indicators of trust and product success.
         - Verified ratings strongly correlated with higher prices (premium products often get better reviews).
         - Low-rated sellers struggled regardless of discounts.

    -  Correlation Matrix
         - Showed strong relationship between discount, current_price, and rating_number.

# Key Insights

- We created an interactive Tableau dashboard to present the results of the analysis in a clear and accessible way. Below are some of the findings:
     - Sellers should avoid extreme discounts; moderate discounts (10â€“30%) balance visibility and profitability.
     - Ratings matter: Products with higher verified ratings perform better, even at higher prices.
     - Phones & Electronics are profitable but crowded, niche categories offer better opportunities for new sellers.
     - A predictive approach to pricing reduces risk for new sellers entering competitive markets.

## Modeling

- The project applied machine learning models to:
    - Predict optimal product prices.
    - Provide sellers with recommendations on optimal pricing.

- Target Variable:current_price (what the customer pays).
- Features: original_price, discount, main_category, rating_number, verified_ratings, etc.

- Model used:
   - Linear Regression: Simple baseline model for price prediction.
   - Decision Tree / Random Forest: Captures non-linear relationships (e.g., how discounts interact with categories).
   - Gradient Boosting: More advanced model for better accuracy.

- We experimented with multiple models (e.g., regression-based and classification-based approaches), evaluated performance, and selected the one that balanced accuracy with interpretability.

- Evaluation matrix: 
   - RÂ² Score: Measures how well the model explains variation in price.
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures average difference between predicted and actual prices.

- Results
    - Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) outperformed linear models.
    - Predictions were accurate enough to recommend competitive price bands by category.


## Deployment

- The project was deployed as a Flask web app and hosted on Render.
- For the Front end, we created a simple website where people can explore the project. The site has diffrent pages:
    - Home â†’ welcoming page with project overview.
    - Data â†’ a page describing the dataset used.
    - Research â†’ key findings and insights.
    - Team â†’ information about the contributors.
- Thereâ€™s also a prediction form where a user can enter product details and instantly see the predicted price.

- The backend uses a Random Forest model trained on our dataset. The outcome is a live, user-friendly web app that makes predictions in real time.

## Conclusion
- This project shows ...... from exploring the dataset and extracting insights, to training a robust predictive model, and finally transforming it into a live, user-friendly web app.
- The result is a practical tool that allows anyone to input product details and instantly receive a predicted price, bridging the gap between data and real-world application. This highlights  can support better decision-making in e-commerce, such as pricing strategies, deal evaluation, and customer awareness.


## Conclusion  
- This project demonstrates the end-to-end process from exploring the dataset and extracting insights, to training a robust predictive model, and finally transforming it into a live, user-friendly web app.  
- The result is a practical tool that allows anyone to input product details and instantly receive a predicted price, effectively bridging the gap between data and real-world application. It also shows how machine learning can support better decision-making in e-commerce, such as pricing strategies, deal evaluation, and customer awareness.  

### Future Work
- While the project is fully functional, thereâ€™s room to expand and improve:
   - Extend beyond price prediction to demand forecasting or profit margin estimation.
   - Incorporate more features like brand popularity, seasonal effects, or customer demographics.

- In summary, this project is not just about predicting prices, itâ€™s about showing how data can be transformed into real-world tools that empower smarter decisions in e-commerce.
